# Accelhints

Accelhints is a library for inserting keyboard Alt-key accelerators (i.e.,
'&'s) in a slice of items (e.g., menu items or dialog labels).

There is also an executable: `accelhints infile.txt > outfile.txt`.

There is also a Python 3 combined library and executable, `accelhints.py` in
the `py` subdirectory which uses the same algorithm but nonetheless produces
slightly different and slightly better results. (Diff
`tests/expected-rs.txt` with `tests/expected-py.txt` to see the
differences.)
